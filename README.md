## Hi, I'm Justin

I'm transitioning into cybersecurity after building a foundation in IT, data, and customer-facing roles. I recently earned my CompTIA Security+ certification and now focus on blue team and SOC-style security work, especially log analysis and detection engineering.

I enjoy breaking down how attacks show up in telemetry and building detections that actually make sense to analysts.

### What I'm working on
- Building and tuning detections in Splunk  
- Analyzing Windows Security Events for suspicious behavior  
- Practicing SOC workflows like triage, investigation, and reporting  

### Tools & Skills
- Splunk, Windows Event Logs, PowerShell, Python  
- VirtualBox, GitHub, Linux  
- CompTIA Security+, Google Cybersecurity Certificate  

### Goal
Join a SOC or security operations team as a junior analyst and continue learning through real incidents, real telemetry, and real collaboration.
