## Hi, I'm Justin

I'm building my career in cybersecurity after a foundation in IT, data, and customer-facing roles. I recently earned my CompTIA Security+ certification and now focus on blue team and SOC-style security work, especially log analysis and detection engineering.

I enjoy breaking down how attacks show up in telemetry and building detections that actually make sense to analysts.

## Portfolio Highlights
- **[Phishing Investigation Lab](https://github.com/PattonJL/phishing-investigation-lab)** — SOC-style phishing triage with header analysis, threat intelligence, and MITRE mapping  
- **[Splunk SIEM Fundamentals](https://github.com/PattonJL/splunk-siem-fundamentals)** — Windows log ingestion and SPL-based detections  
- **[Windows Security Event Analysis](https://github.com/PattonJL/windows-security-event-analysis)** — Authentication event analysis and brute-force detection  

## What I'm working on
- Building and tuning detections in Splunk
- Analyzing Windows Security Events for suspicious behavior
- Practicing SOC workflows like triage, investigation, and reporting

## Tools & Skills
- Splunk, Windows Event Logs, PowerShell, Python
- VirtualBox, GitHub, Linux
- CompTIA Security+, Google Cybersecurity Certificate

## Goal
Join a SOC or security operations team as a junior analyst and contribute to detection, investigation, and incident response while continuing to grow.
