I was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, but have lived in several places across the country including Chattanooga, TN, and Dallas, TX. I've spent over 15 years in sales and the service industry (SI), so I know how the work well with people, but my true passion is in technology. Whether it's hardware or software, I'm fascinated about it and want to learn and grow as much as possible.

Currently, I've just finished my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate provided by Google. I currently have the Data Analytics Certificate provided by Google and the Data Analytics Certificate by IBM. I'm currently studying more about cybersecurity at the moment and trying to strengthen my portfolio. Soon, I'm going to shoot my shot at the CompTIA Security +. I have to say, it's one of the best decisions I've ever made. So far, I've learned Linux, Python, R, SQL, and so much more. And, in the meantime, I continue to tend bar and submit career applications in hopes that an organization sees my potential and dedication.

I can't wait to get the opportunity to work in the field of technology and learn as much as I possibly can, but I know it's only the first step of many. I look forward to obtaining more knowledge and certificates to assist me on my technological journey.
